    * there is alot of dry code and repeated functions. Find a way to clean them. (reusable componentes, generic function?)
    * Enable editing of approved/rejected sick-leavs. (We need to filted existing list in modal and first return not processed sick-leaves, then rejected then approved)
    * Add additional types (Find what the hell are redux reducer types and how to define them)
